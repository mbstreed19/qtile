#+author: Michael Streed

* Purpose
I wanted to try EndevourOS for the first time and when I did I also fell in love with the way they had their 
Qtile set up. I wanted to make it my own and also add in a way to be able to quickly change theme. 

* Features: 
- Modular configuration spread out to make it easy to find what section needs modified. 
- Named workspaces that have affinity for the monitor I want them to be on. 
 
* Tasks that need done
** TODO Get Qtile config Operational [0/4]
- [ ] Add my keybindings

  - [ ] Mouse  
  - [ ] Groups
  - [ ] Hooks 
  - [ ] Layout
* New Features I want to add
** TODO New Features in Qtile Config
